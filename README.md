# SpaceGame

This is a simple Space-Game that I created using Pygame Module in python in about 24hr (18/March/2019 - 19/March/2019) just for self-lerning purpose.

# Disclaimer

I made this game a year ago (today: 25/July/2020). So I don't have a reference or knowledge about who create all the Graphic images in the game. I had just downloaded those from Internet. So if you made any of them and want them removed just Contact Me.
